## Hi, stranger

Thank you for visiting.

I'm Maxim, currently work as a Head of Sales.

My child dream is coding. When I was at high school I started looking for opportunities to learn coding, but, unfortunately, I couldn't figure out with it. 
Now I decided to fix it, because I have to make my dreams come true.
